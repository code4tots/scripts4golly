### Description ###

Some scripts for playing around with golly.

### Installation and usage ###

Simply place the "custom" folder inside the "Python/Script" folder of your golly
installation. For instance, on my windows machine, golly is located at:

C:\Users\math4tots\Documents\tools\golly-2.5-win

So the path to my custom folder should be:

C:\Users\math4tots\Documents\tools\golly-2.5-win\Scripts\Python\custom

Then to use it, simply double click on the script that you want to run from the
scripts list:
